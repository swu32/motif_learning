This repository contains the code, data, and results associated with the publication:

**Wu, S., Thalmann, M., & Schulz, E.** (2025). Two types of motifs enhance human recall and generalization of long sequences. *Communications Psychology, 3*(3). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00180-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00180-8)

In this work, we explore how specific motifs enhance recall and generalization in human memory, using computational models and behavioral experiments.
